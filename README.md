# Neural Network Series

This repository is part of the Neural Network Series' posts I am writing on Medium. Each chapter that contains a more hands-on article is explained with the help of some code snippets that are retrieved originally from notebooks that are under this repository.

Table of Contents:

- [Perceptron](https://github.com/adrianovinhas/neural_networks_series/blob/master/perceptron.ipynb)
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/adrianovinhas/neural_networks_series/blob/master/gradient_descent.ipynb)
- Multilayer Networks
